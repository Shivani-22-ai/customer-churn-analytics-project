# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

### Activities Performed

- Data inspection and quality assessment
- Missing value treatment
- Data type conversion
- Duplicate verification
- Outlier analysis using IQR
- Statistical summaries
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Correlation analysis

### Key Insights

- Average customer tenure is approximately 32 months.
- Average monthly charge is approximately 64.76.
- Month-to-month contracts are the most common contract type.
- Electronic check is the most frequently used payment method.
- Tenure and Total Charges show a strong positive correlation.

# Task 2: SQL for Data Extraction and Analysis

### Activities Performed

- Database creation using SQLite
- SQL query development
- Data aggregation and filtering
- View creation
- SQL-Python integration

### SQL Concepts Used

- SELECT
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- Views
- Aggregate Functions

### Key Findings

- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Long-term customers generate higher revenue and CLTV.
- Customer retention improves significantly with longer contracts.

# Task 3: Data Visualization and Dashboarding

### Tools Used

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Power BI

### Visualizations Created

- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Pairplots
- Interactive Plotly Charts

# Task 4: Advanced Analytics & Predictive Modeling

### Statistical Analysis

- Descriptive Statistics
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Skewness Analysis
- T-Test
- Chi-Square Test
- Confidence Interval Analysis

### Customer Segmentation

- Data Standardization
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method
- PCA Visualization
- Cluster Profiling

### Predictive Modeling

- Train-Test Split
- Feature Encoding
- Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

### Key Findings

- Customer churn is strongly influenced by contract duration and tenure.
- Monthly charges have a significant relationship with churn behavior.
- Customer segments reveal groups with different retention characteristics.
- Logistic Regression successfully predicts customer churn patterns.
- Predictive analytics can support proactive customer retention strategies.

## Results

- Dataset: 7,043 IBM Telco customers, with an overall churn rate of 26.5%
- Churn rate by contract type: month-to-month 42.7%, one-year 11.3%, two-year 2.8%
- Month-to-month customers churned at about 15 times the rate of two-year customers
- An Excel PivotTable summarizing customers, average CLTV and churn rate by contract type is in `telco_churn_pivot.xlsx`
